				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>The LTE Constitution states that the seat to voter ratio may be determined by a majority vote in Congress. This bill aims to implement an algorithm which would create the seat to voter ratio that is the most proportional before each election.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="A3">
				<h3>Article I: Use of the Alogithm</h3>
				<h4>Section 1: Time of Use</h4>
				<p>The algorithm is to be used the day of the primary elections of any midterm or general election in order to determine the number of seats in the House of Representatives for each region. This algorithm will also give the seat to voter ratio for the next house term.</p>
				<h4>Section 2: How to Use</h4>
				<p>In order to use the algorithm, the user must first enter the number of registered voters in each region when prompted to do so, by typing in the number and then pressing enter. The algorithm will immediately return the number of seats for each region and the seat to voter ratio for the next house term. The enter key may be pressed until the number of seats for each region is satisfactory to the Secretary of State. After the election, whatever the seat to voter ratio was calculated to be at the start of the election, shall be the seat to voter ratio for the rest of the house term, where dividing the number of voters in a region by the seat to voter ratio produces the number of seats for that region, which must be rounded to the nearest whole number. If the division creates a number equidistant from two whole numbers, (ex. 4.5) then the number of seats will be rounded up to the nearest whole number.</p>
				<h4>Section 3: Result Verification</h4>
				<p>The result of the algorithm must be verified by the Secretary of State. They are to use the algorithm that is given in Article II of this act. The code may not be edited unless a majority of Congress votes to do so. The code known to run correctly in a Python 3.6 compiler on Windows 10. The code must be available to all citizens of the LTE Discord server through the following GitHub repository link in the file named, idea.py: <a href="https://github.com/Botahamec/ASCA-Algorithm" class="link">https://github.com/Botahamec/ASCA-Algorithm</a></p>
