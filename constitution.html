				<h3>The Preamble</h3>
					<p>We the people of the LTE Discord, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the LTE Discord.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="A3">
				<h3>Article I</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The Congress</h4>
						<p>All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the LTE Discord, which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives. The Congress by their adjournment, in a supermajority vote, prevents a law’s return, in which case, it shall not be law.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: The Representatives</h4>
						<p>The house of representatives shall be composed of members based on population chosen every month by the people of the LTE Discord. A representative is awarded per every 8 registered voters in a state, the Congress has the power to change this number with a simple majority vote. Representatives shall have a 1 month-long term, with no number of term limits. Every representative shall have attained 10 days in the discord (not including the at the time this Constitution is adopted), and when elected, be an inhabitant of the state in which he or she shall be chosen. Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined population. The house of representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers; and shall have the sole power of impeachment.</p>
					<h4>Section 3: The Senators</h4>
						<p>The Senate of the United States shall be composed of 1 senator from each state, for a term limit of 2 months; and each senator shall have one vote. Senators shall have attained 15 days on the discord, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he or she shall be chosen. The Vice President of the United States shall be president of the senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the president of the United States is tried, the chief justice shall preside: And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="A4">
				<h3>Article II</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The President</h4>
						<p>The executive power shall be vested in a president of the LTE Discord. He shall hold his office during the term of two months with a limit of two terms only, and, together with the vice president, chosen for the same term, be elected, as follows: President shall have attained 20 days a member within the LTE Discord, except at the time this Constitution is adopted. The president, or acting president, has the sole authority to forbid the passage of any law passed by the Congress. The electoral college voting system (winner takes all per each state) will be implemented once a 270 registered voter landmark is attained. Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation: - "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the LTE Discord, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the LTE Discord." Executive orders are allowed, but are allowed to be struck down by the court’s judicial review.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: The Cabinet</h4>
						<p>The Congress has the power to create and abolish administrative departments and agencies, however the Department of Justice, headed by the Attorney General, and the Department of State, headed by the Secretary of State, shall not be abolished, as they are constitutionally established. The president has the authority to choose and nominate the heads of cabinet departments and their corresponding agencies. However, the Senate only has the power to approve these nominations in a simple majority vote of all present Senators.</p>
					<h4>Section 3: Impeachment of the President</h4>
						<p>The president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. In case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice president, and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or inability, both of the president and vice president, declaring what officer shall then act as president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected. The president can be impeached in a ⅗ vote in the House of Representatives and a ⅔ vote in the Senate. Impeachment shall start in the House of Representatives and then a trial shall occur in the Senate with the Supreme Court presiding over the case.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="A5">
				<h3>Article III</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The Supreme Court</h4>
						<p>The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices for 3 months with good behavior.</p>

				<h2>The First Amendment</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="B2">
				<h3>Preamble</h3>
					<p>The First Amendment guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition.  It forbids Congress from both promoting one religion over others and also restricting an individual’s religious practices.  It guarantees freedom of expression by prohibiting Congress from restricting the press or the rights of individuals to speak freely.  It also guarantees the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and to petition their government. These also guarantees apply to the state and local governments.</p>
					<p><i>“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”</i></p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="B3">
				<h3>Article I: The Freedom of Religion</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The Estabishment Clause</h4>
						<p>This Establishment Clause prohibits the government from passing legislation to establish an official religion or preferring one religion over another. It enforces the "separation of church and state." However, the following government activity surrounding religion is allowed.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: The Free Excersize Clause</h4>
						<p>The Free Exercise Clause reserves the right of American citizens to accept any religious belief and engage in religious rituals. Free-exercise clauses of state constitutions which protected religious “[o]pinion, expression of opinion, and practice were all expressly protected” by the Free Exercise Clause.[1]  The Clause protects not just religious beliefs but actions made on behalf of those beliefs.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="B4">
				<h3>Article II: The Freedom of Expression (Speech and Press)</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Freedom of Speech and Press</h4>
						<p>The right to freedom of speech allows individuals to express themselves without government interference or regulation. The Supreme Court requires the government to provide substantial justification for the interference with the right of free speech where it attempts to regulate the content of the speech. Generally, a person cannot be held liable, either criminally or civilly for anything written or spoken about a person or topic, so long as it is truthful or based on an honest opinion, and such statements</p>
					<h4>Section 2: Freedom of Expression Limitations: Advocacy of Illegal Actions (AKA Clear and Present Danger)</h4>
						<p>Advocacy of illegal actions is a category of speech unprotected by the First Amendment.  For many years, the constitutional rule famously was that speech was unprotected if "words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent."  Schenck v. United States, 249 US 47 (1919).  However, the current rule is that "the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action." Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 US 444 (1969).</p>
					<h4>Section 2, Subsection 1: Identification of Advocacy of Illegal Actions: Brandenburg Test</h4>
						<p>The Brandenburg Test is a standard established in  Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 US 444 (1969), to determine when inflammatory speech intending to advocate illegal action can be restricted. The standard developed determined that speech advocating the use of force or crime could only be prescribed where two conditions were satisfied: (1) the advocacy is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action,” and (2) the advocacy is also “likely to incite or produce such action.”</p>
					<h4>Section 3: Freedom of Speech Limitations: Fighting Words</h4>
						<p>Fighting words are, as first defined by the Supreme Court in Chaplinsky v New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), words which "by their very utterance, inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality."</p>
					<h4>Section 3, Subsection 1: Supreme Court Clarifications of Fighting Words: Terminiello v. City of Chicago (1949)</h4>
						<p>In Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949), the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of what constitutes fighting words. The Court found that words which produce a clear and present danger are unprotected (and are considering fighting words), but words which invite dispute and causes unrest are protected (and are not considered fighting words).</p>
					<h4>Section 3, Subsection 2: Supreme Court Clarifications of Fighting Words: Feiner v. New York (1951)</h4>
						<p>In Feiner v. People of State of New York, 30 U.S. 315 (1951), the Supreme Court held that akin to the fighting words doctrine, an incitement to riot which creates a clear and present danger is also not protected by the First Amendment.</p>
					<h4>Section 3, Subsection 3: Supreme Court Clarifications of Fighting Words: Texas v. Johnson (1989)</h4>
						<p>In Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), the Supreme Court redefined the scope of the fighting words doctrine to mean words that are "a direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs." In the case, the Court held that the burning of a United States flag, which was considered symbolic speech, did not constitute fighting words.</p>
					<h4>Section 3, Subsection 4: Supreme Court Clarifications of Fighting Words: Texas v. Johnson (1989)</h4>
						<p>In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992), the Supreme Court found that the "First Amendment prevents government from punishing speech and expressive conduct because it disapproves of the ideas expressed." Even if the words are considered to be fighting words, the First Amendment will still protect the speech if the speech restriction is based on viewpoint discrimination.</p>
					<h4>Section 3[sic]: Freedom of Expression Limitations: Commercial Speech</h4>
						<p>Commercial speech has been defined by the Supreme Court as speech where the speaker is more likely to be engaged in commerce, where the intended audience is commercial or actual or potential consumers, and where the content of the message is commercial in character. Commercial speech, such as advertisements, has been ruled by the Supreme Court to be entitled to less protection under the First Amendment than noncommercial speech. Under the First Amendment, noncommercial speech is entitled to full protection, and any sort of content-based regulation is only valid if it can withstand strict scrutiny. However, commercial speech is not given such deference. For a content-based regulation of commercial speech to be valid, it only must withstand intermediate scrutiny. Additionally, commercial speech that is false or misleading is not entitled to any protection under the First Amendment, and therefore can be prohibited entirely.</p>
					<h4>Section 4: Freedom of Expression Limitations: Obscenity</h4>
						<p>Obscenity is a category of speech unprotected by the First Amendment. Obscenity laws are concerned with prohibiting lewd, filthy, or disgusting words or pictures. Indecent materials or depictions, normally speech or artistic expressions, may be restricted in terms of time, place, and manner, but are still protected by the First Amendment. There are major disagreements regarding obscene material and the government's role in regulation. All fifty states have individual laws controlling obscene material. A comprehensive, legal definition of obscenity has been difficult to establish. Yet, key components of the current obscenity test stem from the U.S. Court of Appeals decision in United States v. One Book Entitled Ulysses, which determined that a work investigated for obscenity must be considered in its entirety and not merely judged on its parts.</p>
					<h4>Section 4, Subsection 1: Supreme Court Clarifications of Obscenity: Miller v. California and the Miller Test</h4>
						<p>Currently, obscenity is evaluated by federal and state courts alike using a tripartite standard established by Miller v. California. The Miller test for obscenity includes the following criteria: (1) whether ‘the average person, applying contemporary community standards’ would find that the work, ‘taken as a whole,’ appeals to ‘prurient interest’ (2) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (3) whether the work, ‘taken as a whole,’ lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="B5">
				<h3>Article III: Freedom of Assembly and Petition</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Freedom of Assembly and Petition</h4>
						<p>The right to assemble allows people to gather for peaceful and lawful purposes. Implicit within this right is the right to association and belief. This implicit right is limited to the right to associate for First Amendment purposes. It does not include a right of social association. The government may prohibit people from knowingly associating in groups that engage and promote illegal activities. The right to associate also prohibits the government from requiring a group to register or disclose its members or from denying government benefits on the basis of an individual's current or past membership in a particular group. There are exceptions to this rule where the Court finds that governmental interests in disclosure/registration outweigh interference with First Amendment rights. The government may also, generally, not compel individuals to express themselves, hold certain beliefs, or belong to particular associations or groups.</p>

				<h2>The Second Amendment</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="C2">
				<h3>Preamble</h3>
					<p>The Second Amendment expands upon the Discord Constitution to include all applicable clauses, sections and subsections included in the original Constitution. Not only does this amendment expand upon the rights of Americans, it clarifies many grey areas previously unaddressed. It also includes many of the incontrovertible and de rigeur civil rights and liberties excluded from the original Constitution because of the racism, sexism and lack of progress that sadly transcend our nation’s history.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="C3">
				<h3>Article I: Fundamental Congressional Clarifications</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The Basket Clause (Or Elastic Clause)</h4>
						<p><i>“The Congress shall have Power ... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.”</i></p>
						<p>The basket clause simply states that Congress has the power, “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.” However, in order for this clause to be carried out, the laws enacted pursuant to the Clause must be (1) necessary, (2) proper, and (3) for carrying into execution some other federal power. This does not give Congress new power, only clarifies its existing ones.</p>
						<p>No member or citizen of the LTE Discord, when elected or appointed to a position in government, shall hold another elected or appointed position at the same time. This shall apply to all legislative seats, all judicial appointments, the President and Vice-President, and all cabinet positions currently existing or which shall exist in the future.</p>
						<p>No member or citizen of the LTE Discord, when elected or appointed to a position in government, shall hold another elected or appointed position at the same time. This shall apply to all legislative seats, all judicial appointments, the President and Vice-President, and all cabinet positions currently existing or which shall exist in the future.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: The Commerce Clause</h4>
						<p><i>“[The Congress shall have Power] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;”</i></p>
					<h4>Section 3: The Compact Clause</h4>
						<p><i>“No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.”</i></p>
						<p>Under the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace. They may not enter into alliances nor compacts with foreign states, nor engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. (Article I, Section 8, enumerated powers of Congress.)</p>
					<h4>Section 4: The Contract Clause</h4>
						<p><i>“No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.”</i></p>
						<p>The Contract Clause prohibits states from enacting any law that retroactively impairs contract rights. The Contract Clause applies only to state legislation, not federal legislation or court decisions.</p>
					<h4>Section 5: The Copyright Clause</h4>
						<p><i>“the United States Congress shall have power "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."</i></p>
						<p>The clause confers two distinct powers: the power to secure for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their writings is the basis for U.S. copyright law, and the power to secure for limited times to inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries is the basis for U.S. patent law. Because the clause contains no language under which Congress may protect trademarks, those are instead protected under the Commerce Clause. Some terms in the clause are used in archaic meanings, potentially confusing modern readers.</p>
					<h4>Section 6: The Emoluments (Ineligibility) Clause</h4>
						<p><i>“No Senator or Representative [or any high level office] shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."</i></p>
						<p>The emoluments clause makes each incumbent member of Congress ineligible to hold an office established by the federal government during their tenure in Congress; it also bars officials in the federal government's executive and judicial branches from simultaneously serving in either the U.S. House or Senate (including positions within the Congress). The purpose of the clause is twofold: first, to protect the separation of powers philosophy (upon which the federal frame of government is built); and second, to prevent Congress from conspiring to create offices or increase federal officials' salaries with the expectation that members of Congress would later be appointed to these posts.</p>
					<h4>Section 7: The Enclave (Enumerated Powers) Clause</h4>
						<p>The Congress shall have power (in all states, districts, territories etc.) To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States; To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures; To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current coin of the United States; To establish Post Offices and post Roads; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries; To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court; To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations; To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years; To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces; To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dockyards, and other needful Buildings;—And To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.</p>
					<h4>Section 8: The Limitations Clause</h4>
						<p>The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person. The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it. No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed. No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken. No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State. No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another. No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time. No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.</p>
					<h4>Section 9: The Origination Clause</h4>
						<p>The Origination Clause, sometimes called the Revenue Clause, is part of Article I of the United States Constitution. This clause says that all bills for raising revenue must start in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as in the case of other bills.</p>
					<h4>Section 10: The Presentment Clause</h4>
						<p>The Presentment Clause (Article I, Section 7, Clauses 2 and 3) of the United States Constitution outlines federal legislative procedure by which bills originating in Congress become federal law in the United States.</p>

				<h3>Article II: Fundamental Presidential Clarifications</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The Appointments Clause</h4>
						<p>The Appointments Clause is part of Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, which empowers the President of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent (confirmation) of the United States Senate, appoint public officials. Although the Senate must confirm certain "principal" officers (including ambassadors, Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, and United States Attorneys), Congress may by law delegate the Senate's advice and consent role when it comes to "inferior" officers (to the President alone, or the courts of law, or the heads of departments).</p>
					<h4>Section 2: The Treaty Clause</h4>
						<p>The Treaty Clause is part of Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, of the United States Constitution, that empowers the President of the United States to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries, which, upon receiving the advice and consent of a two-thirds supermajority vote of the United States Senate, become treaties under international law.</p>

				<h3>Article III: Fundamental Judicial Clarifications</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The Arisings Clause</h4>
						<p>Clause 2 of Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls, and also in those controversies which are subject to federal judicial power because at least one state is a party; the Court has held that the latter requirement is met if the United States has a controversy with a state.[7][8] In other cases, the Supreme Court has only appellate jurisdiction, which may be regulated by the Congress. The Congress may not, however, amend the Court's original jurisdiction, as was found in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (Cranch 1) 137 (1803) (the same decision which established the principle of judicial review). Marbury held that Congress can neither expand nor restrict the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. However, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is different. The Court's appellate jurisdiction is given "with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make."</p>
					<h4>Section 2: The Case or Controversy</h4>
						<p>The Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted the Case or Controversy Clause of Article III of the United States Constitution (found in Art. III, Section 2, Clause 1) as embodying two distinct limitations on exercise of judicial review. First, the Court has held that the clause identifies the scope of matters which a federal court can and cannot consider as a case (i.e., it distinguishes between lawsuits within and beyond the institutional competence of the federal judiciary), and limits federal judicial power only to such lawsuits as the court is competent to hear. Secondly, the Court has interpreted the clause as limiting Congress' ability to confer jurisdiction on federal courts. It does so by establishing an outer limit of the types of matters within which Congress may constitutionally confer jurisdiction. Historically, the Court has not interpreted this Clause to limit Congressional power to restrict the jurisdiction of the federal courts.</p>

				<h3>Article IV: De Rigeur Civil Rights and Liberties</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The Right to Vote (Race, Sex, Age and Abolition of Slavery)</h4>
						<p>The Fifteenth Amendment (Amendment XV) to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". Furthermore, the Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. Also, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. On the LTE Discord, the right to vote shall not be denied based on age.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: Rights of the District of Columbia</h4>
						<p>The citizens living in the District of Columbia shall be allowed to vote in elections, just as the citizens of other states are (DC is considered Southeast).</p>
					<h4>Section 3: The Abolition of Voting Requirements</h4>
						<p>The Twenty-fourth Amendment (Amendment XXIV) of the United States Constitution prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="C7">
				<h3>Article V: Other Indespensible Clarifications</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: The Direct Election of Senators</h4>
						<p>The Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution established the popular election of United States Senators by the people of the states. The amendment supersedes Article I, §3, Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, under which senators were elected by state legislatures.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: Supersession of Archaic Election Practices</h4>
						<p>The Twelfth Amendment (Amendment XII) to the United States Constitution provides the procedure for electing the President and Vice President. It replaced the procedure provided in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, by which the Electoral College originally functioned. Problems with the original procedure arose in the elections of 1796 and 1800. The Twelfth Amendment refined the process whereby a President and a Vice President are elected by the Electoral College.</p>
					<h4>Section 3: Succession of the President</h4>
						<p>Section 1[sic]. In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.</p>
						<p>Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.</p>
						<p>Section 3. Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.</p>
						<p>Section 4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.</p>

				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>Throughout the history of the LTE Congress, it’s been widely accepted and understood that for purposes of bills and legality, this server inherits all the established legislation, legal structure, and laws of the United States of America, and yet, this has never been officially recognized by our constitution or any formal legislature.

			<div class="section" id="F1"><h2>Supreme Court Fixation Amendment</h2></div>
			<div class="section" id="F2">
				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>In the current state of the LTE server, the Supreme Court has absolutely no practical use or application and seems to only differentiate itself from the remainder of the civilian population with their flashy, appealing “Supreme Court Justice” title . This bill will seek to resolve this issue by giving making a significant changes to the Supreme Court. The major change this amendment makes is that the current number of Justices at the passing of amendment to 5. This will ensure that there will be enough justices at any given moment to hear a case. This bill will be placed into effect as soon as it has been passed.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="F3">
				<h3>Article I: Justices</h3>
				<h4>Section 1: Number of Justices</h4>
				<p>The number of Justices in the Supreme Court was originally 3, but can be changed at any time due to it not being in the constitution. This means Congress can change the number of Justices at any time to any odd number with ⅔ voting in favor. However, at this point in time of amendment writing, only 2 active Justices. This amendment will increase the total number of Justices to 5, and Congress can choose to change this number at anytime with vote. This amendment will also require there to be simple majority of the justices for the listening of a case, which will be further elaborated on in Section II.</p>
				<h4>Section 2: Listening of the Case</h4>
				<p>When a case arises, SCOTUS will hereby be required to hold a vote regarding the validity of the case. If they rule in favor, a simple majority of the  justices will need to be present for the case to be heard. Along with this, all parties must agree on a time to for the trial to take place.  When a simple majority of the Justices are present along with the accused/defendant and plaintiff/prosecutor, the Chief Justice will proceed on with the trial until a verdict has been reached among the Justices that are present. The appropriate actions will be taken and the trial will conclude.</p>
				<h4>Section 3: Provisional Justices</h4>
				<p>One of the primary problems we have with the current Justices that comprise the SCOTUS is severe inactivity. If a Justice will be inactive for a 7 day period, the Justice is assigned a Provisional Justice to assume his or her role in SCOTUS for the period he or she is out. If a Justice is out for 21 days without a statement being released or the absence of being active, Congress has the ability to remove the Justice with a majority vote.</p>

				<h3>Article II: Court Cases</h3>
				<h4>Section 1: Rights to Trial</h4>
				<p>Any member of the LTE Discord server can request a case regarding any party, group, faction or member be heard by the Supreme Court, and the case will be heard if the Supreme Court agrees upon hearing it. SCOTUS can also choose not to hear the case if they do not have enough members to listen at a given time or if don’t believe the case is deserving of their time and attention.</p>
				<h4>Section 2: Repealed Frivolous Cases</h4>
				<p>A member of the LTE server can only ask to go to the courts if their punishment is more severe than  3 hour mute. Anything less than that, ex. 30 minute mute or warning is not appealable. If a member of LTE constantly attempts to go to SCOTUS for an issue that is not worth their time and attention but continues to waste time over it, the SCOTUS will request an admin or mod to put a punishment on the member in a series of mutes and kicks which follows like this:</p>
				<p>
					1st Offense: Warning from Chief Justice or Mod<br>
					2nd Offense: 6 hour mute, unappealable<br>
					3rd Offense: 10 hour mute, unappealable<br>
					4th Offense: 16 hour mute, unappealable<br>
					5th Offense: 3 day ban<br>
					6th Offense: Week long ban<br>
					7th Offense: Further offenses will result in a permanent ban<br>
				</p>
				<h4>Section 3: Failure to Comply with Court Date</h4>
				<p>If either the prosecuting side or the defendants side fails to show up on the date of the trial. The user will have to deal with a punishment as decided upon by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will decide that punishment and request an admin to administer the punishment</p>
