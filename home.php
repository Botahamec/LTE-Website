				<h3>What happens here?</h3>
				<p>We act as a mock country. We hold elections, we have representatives, we have a president. Here, you can view the LTE Constitution, the laws and bills, and all of the elections. I will expand this in the future, but for now, enjoy everything the site has to offer.</p>
				<p>Sorry this update took a while, I was in Europe for over a week. The new bills are coming soon.</p>
				<p>Also, if you see any mistakes, tell me. Alright, enjoy.</p>
