				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>Inactivity is a growing crisis in our Congress. To prevent an overabundance of inactivity, I propose that the Congress can diagnose when a fellow Congressman is deemed inactive. A ⅔ vote in the alleged inactive Congressman’s own chamber will result in the impeachment of the inactive congressman, but then the Attorney General will approve this impeachment.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="A3">
				<h3>Article I: The Requirements of Inactivity Impeachment</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Qualifications of an Inactive Congressperson</h4>
						<p>The Congress cannot simply impeach any congressman anytime. In order to qualify as inactive, the Senator must have not sent a meaningful message into the main discord in 18 days, and a representative 10 . A meaningful message means a conversation, announcement, or something on those lines. It means everything except a single sentence or phrase, to simply make them inactive. Those who are seriously sick are excluded.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: Declarations of Inactivity</h4>
						<p>If a Congressman knows that he/she will be inactive for a period of time, he/she must notify the majority leader of the Senate, or speaker of the house, depending on their chamber, then Speaker/majority leader will ensure that no movements to impeach the temporarily inactive congressman. Reasons for temporary inactivity include but are not limited to vacation, lack of Internet connection, serious sickness. If the congressman does not want to reveal the reason for inactivity (because of its sensitive nature, such as suicidal thoughts, etc.) he/she may have a temporary 10 day break, with approval from the Attorney General and leader of their chamber (Speaker in the house, majority leader in the Senate). If the congressman wishes to extend the length of this secret inactivity, the Attorney General and chamber leader may do so. Reasons for declared inactivity may include exam season, however this should not be declared too often, as the congressman should be able to be relatively active. However, if the chamber leader and Attorney General feel that it is acceptable, they may approve the declaration.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="A4">
				<h3>Article II: Process of Inactivity Impeachment</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Formal Impeachment Process</h4>
						<p>When a congressman reaches the requirements above for inactivity, the congressman’s own chamber may begin a movement for impeachment and the movement can be approved by a ⅔ vote. Then, the Attorney General may approve the movement.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: Attorney General Approval</h4>
						<p>While the Attorney General may deny the movement, he/she must have a good reason to do so. Good reasons include but are not limited to: the Congress had too strict of an interpretation of the inactivity requirements, the Congress did not include some evidence in their movement, etc. Reasons with no merit include: the Congressman is a necessary member of a certain party, a certain party needs this congressman’s vote. When the Attorney General approves of the impeachment, the congressman will be removed, and there will be a special election to replace the congressman. If the attorney general denies the movement, the movement is dismantled and a new movement is needed.</p>
