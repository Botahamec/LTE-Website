				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>This bill will prohibit discrimination in adoption or foster care placements based on the sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status of any prospective adoptive or foster parent, or that of the child involved. It will become effective immediately after Congressional passage and Presidential signature.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="A3">
				<h3>Article I: Rationale</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Findings</h4>
					<p>After researching, the following has been concluded:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>There is a shortage of qualified individuals willing to adopt or foster a child in the child welfare system. As a result, thousands of children lack a permanent and/or safe home.</li>
						<li>In order to open more homes for foster children, child welfare agencies should eliminate sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status discrimination and bias in adoption and foster care recruitment, selection, and placement.</li>
						<li>Of the estimated 427,910 children in the United States foster care system, at least 100,000 cannot return to their families and are legally free for adoption.
							<ol type="a">
								<li>In 2015, 53,549 children were adopted, while 20,789 ‘aged out’ of the system.</li>
								<li>Research shows that youth who ‘age out’ of the system are at a high risk of poverty, homelessness, incarceration, and early parenthood.</li>
								<li>Increasing adoption rates, in addition to establishing permanency and decreasing the risks of for foster youth, can yield annual national savings between $3.3-6.3 billion.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Experts agree that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, etc. youth experience discrimination, harassment, and violence in the foster care system because of their status.</li>
						<li>Approximately 60% of homeless LGBT youth were previously in foster care. According to the Urban Justice Center, many of these young people say they feel ‘safer’ living on the streets than in foster care.</li>
						<li>According to the Williams Institute, around 19% of same-sex couple households include children under 18 years of age.</li>
						<li>As of 2013, same-sex couples are raising 1.4% of adopted children with 2 parents, and are fostering 1.7% of foster children living with 2 parents. A 2007 Williams Institute report found that an additional 2,000,000 gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are interested in adoption.</li>
						<li>The Williams Institute/Urban Institute found that same-sex couples raising adopted children tend to be: older than, just as educated as, and have access to the same economic resources as other adoptive parents. Studies confirm that children with same-sex parents have the same advantages and same expectations for health, social, and psychological adjustment, and development as children whose parents are heterosexual.
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Barring applicants for adoption and foster parenthood on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status has resulted in reducing the number of qualified adoptive and foster parents. This also, in many cases, prevents qualified LGBT applicants from adopting their own relatives out of the system after a parental death.</li>
								<li>As of 2013, the Williams Institute found, more than 3,400 children currently live in a foster home with a same-sex couple. Another 22,000 children are being raised by same-sex adoptive couples. If these discriminatory practices spread, they estimate spending to increase by between $87-130 million yearly to compensate.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Some states allow a single member of an unmarried couple to adopt, but refuse to acknowledge the second parent as the legal parent of the child. Recognition of joint adoption by unmarried couples provides children with the same rights and security that other children enjoy, and provide access to the second parent’s health benefits, survivor’s, Social Security, and child support entitlements to the child. They also enable both parents to consent to medical care, education, and other important decisions of permanency for parents and children.</li>
						<li>After research showed that sexual orientation is a non-determinative factor in parental success, professional organizations in the fields of medicine, psychology, law, and child welfare have taken official positions in support of the ability of qualified gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried couples to foster and/or adopt children.</li>
						<li>Several states have “conscience clause” laws that permit agencies and case workers to delay or deny placements to anyone with whom they have a religious or moral objection.</li>
						<li>Discrimination against qualified potential foster or adoptive parents is not in the best interests of foster children.</li>
