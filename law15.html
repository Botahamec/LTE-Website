				<h3>Preamble</h3>
					<p>This bill aims to fully protect minors from dangerous marital relationships. The Congress has found that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A February 2017 study by Unchained At Last found that, between 2000 and 2010, 248,000 children had been married in the United States, mostly to adult men.</li>
						<li>The United States Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls, released last year by the State Department recognizes marriage before 18 to be a “human rights abuse”.</li>
						<li>Child marriages in the United States have included parties as young as 10</li>
						<li>Marriages in the United States have given a semblance of legitimacy to relationships that would otherwise be illegal.</li>
						<li>Women who marry at 18 or younger face a 23 percent higher risk of heart attack, diabetes, cancer and stroke than do women who marry between ages 19 and 25.</li>
						<li>Women who wed before 18 also are at increased risk of developing various psychiatric disorders.</li>
						<li>American girls who marry before 19 are 50 percent more likely than their unmarried peers to dropout of high school and four times less likely to graduate from college.</li>
						<li>A girl who marries young is 31 percentage points more likely to live in poverty when she is older.</li>
						<li>Women who marry before 18 are three times more likely to be beaten by their spouses than women who wed at 21 or older.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Article I: Banning of Child Marriage</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: What is Child Marriage?</h4>
						<p>In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word “marriage” means only a legal union between two people of marriageable age, and the word “spouse” refers only to a person of marriageable age. This definition only applies if a judge has approved of the marriage.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: Banning of Child Marriage</h4>
						<p>Child marriage is not permitted in the United States. No State shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State respecting a relationship where one or both persons are below the marriageable age that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, or a right or claim arising from such relationship.</p>
