				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>To re-establish order in Congress, this bill aims to resolve the long-standing argument over electoral oversight, as well as the order in which names are presented on voting ballots. This bill will become effective upon congressional passage and the signature of the President.</p>

				<h3>Article I: Amending the Election Initiation and Process Act</h3>
				<h4>Section 1: Amendment I</h4>
				<p>Following Article I, Section V, Paragraph two of the Election Initiation and Process Act, the following will be inserted:</p>
				<ol><li>To maintain the integrity of our elections, all ballots must give edit access to every Staff member having attained the rank of “(Mod) Lesser Admin” or higher. Format for the ballot must comply with the Election Initiation and Process Act. Any ballot measure or election which is not carried out subject to the aforementioned regulations can be nullified by the Secretary of State if they are presented with credible evidence that the act was committed deliberately to influence the outcome of an election or ballot measure. If the Secretary of State is at all implicated in the illegal activity, however, the power of nullification is turned over to the Supreme Court.</li></ol>
				<h4>Section 2: Amendment II</h4>
				<p>Following Article I, Section V, Paragraph three of the Election Initiation and Process Act, the following will be inserted:</p>
				<ol><li>The order in which choices appear on the ballot will be determined by randomization. Input/responses on all ballot measures and elections must be sorted randomly, using tools found within Google Forms. Any ballot measure or election which is not carried out via randomization after this bill becomes effective can be nullified by the Secretary of State if they are presented with credible evidence that the act was committed deliberately to influence the outcome of an election or ballot measure. If the Secretary of State is at all implicated in the illegal activity, however, the power of nullification is turned over to the Supreme Court.</li></ol>
