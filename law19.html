				<h3>Preamble</h3>
					<p>The PATRIOT Act signed into law President George W. Bush in response to the tragic terrorist attacks on 9-11 has violated the right to privacy, civil liberties, and civil rights while many sections of the bill are not effective in countering terrorism.  While there are sections of the bill that protect the United States against terrorism, others allow for information to be collected and stored while having no effect on terrorism. The detention center at Guantanamo bay also is in violation of the constitution of the United States while having little to no effect on defending against terrorism and that will be closed in this bill. The main idea for this bill was inspired by Johnygotfire. This bill shall come into effect promptly after being signed into law.</p>

				<h3>Article I: The PATRIOT Act</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Repealed Provisions of PATRIOT</h4>
						<p>The permission of American intelligence agencies to listen in to and record any conversation between any citizen is hereby repealed. Intelligence agencies may, however, listen in to the conversations of those convicted of treasonous acts that completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. American intelligence agencies may also no longer record and store personal information which belongs American citizens or legal immigrants living in the mainland or in American territories without a warrant. Intelligence agency, customs, and security officers may also not detain individuals on evidence collected without a warrant. The section of PATRIOT that prohibits individuals from informing others about search orders they were given is also repealed alongside repealing the section that allows intelligence agencies to carry out secret searches without a special order from a court. The attorney general may also no longer detain immigrants from other countries on the ground of suspicion but may do so with evidence obtained with a warrant. </p>
					<h4>Section 2: Sustained Provisions of PATRIOT</h4>
						<p>Provisions not repealed in Section I which are included in PATRIOT are to remain in effect as law.</p>

				<h3>Article II: Guantanamo Bay Detention Center</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Close of Guantanamo Bay</h4>
					<p>The detention center at Guantanamo Bay, currently used to hold and torture suspected terrorists, is hereby closed. All detainees convicted of crimes are to be moved to prison facilities within the mainland United States or other territories while those detained without evidence are to be freed. Detainees not convicted of crimes that have evidence against them are to undergo trials in a United States court, be they citizens or foreigners. Current funding used to operate the facility is to be redirected to categorical grants for public schools given by the Department of Education and the Secretary of Education will decide how to distribute the grants among schools in the United States. The naval base at Guantanamo will remain in operation.</p>
