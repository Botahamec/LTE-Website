				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>As concern for cases of police brutality grows, more and more proposals are being presented regarding ways we could  prevent police brutality from occurring, mitigate the negative effects it has, and bring the perpetrators of it to justice. This act originally was proposed by Jacket, a citizen of the west, and we’ve been tasked with writing it. In an attempt to further monitor and supervise the actions of police officers and deter them from abusing their power, this act will obligate police officers to wear mandatory body mounted cameras that must follow a stringent set of requirements and laws that will be outlined in this bill. Any police officers who fail to comply with these requirements will be subjected to punishment that has been deemed fitting by their supervisors, as outlined in Article 2. This bill will go into effect on January 1st, 2019</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="A3">
				<h3>Article I: Requirements and Administration of Body Mounted Cameras</h3>
				<h4>Section 1: Requirements of Body Cameras</h4>
				<p>Body cameras of these police officers all are here to serve a basic function, to keep both citizens safe and to keep our officers safe. In order to do this, each camera will need to have basic functions. These are the mandatory functions each camera must have:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Night Vision</li>
					<li>120 degree Vision</li>
					<li>Up to 8 hours of video recording</li>
					<li>A time stamp</li>
					<li>Minimum 480p resolution, recommended 720p or above</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Section 2: Administration of Body Mounted Cameras</h4>
				<p>As of this bill’s signing and passage into law, all police departments across the U.S are hereby obligated to equip each officer with body mounted cameras that abide by the requirements listed above. These cameras can possess any combination of other features and be priced at any possible price point as long as the selected design and model is approved by ⅔’s of the police departments governing body. All officers must be outfitted with recording cameras at all times while on duty, with all officers being given battery packs to recharge the batteries of these cameras if necessary. If any incident regarding an on-duty police officer is reported to the police department, footage from the body cam could be subjected to review at any moment</p>
				<h4>Section 3: Example of High Quality Camera</h4>
				<p>Police Body Cam created by Generix LLC. 32 GB, Waterproof, Night Vision, 1296p and 140 degree vision. Link is below.</p>

				<h3>Article II: Punishment In Failure to Comply</h3>
				<h4>Section 1: First time offenders</h4>
				<p>If and when an officer does not have his or her camera on while on duty, the supervisor in charge of the police agency has one of two options. Option one which should be taken a majority of the times is a warning to the police officer to make sure to always have it on at all times. In more severe cases in which a weapon was used by the officer, a temporary leave shall be taken to investigate the case.</p>
				<h4>Section 2: Second time offenders</h4>
				<p>In another minor offense where an officer did not have a camera while on duty, another warning shall be issued along with a response from this officer on why he or she did not have his or her camera. A suspension shall also be included ranging from 3 days to a week depending on the severity of the case and the leniency of the supervisor.</p>
				<h4>Section 3: Multiple Time Offenders</h4>
				<p>If an officer is a multiple time offender, ex. three or more, the first action that should be taken is a suspension ranging from one to two months depending on the severity of the case. Every offense should be met with that response. Along with every offense after two, the officer is required to give a response to the department on why he or she did not have her body camera on while on duty. After five offenses, the department will investigate this officer’s case. After 6 offenses, this officer must be let go.</p>
				<h4>Section 4: Clearing The Record</h4>
				<p>After every 2 years on January 1st, all records are clear and everyone is reset with 0 offenses with the exception of police officers on their 5th offense who start out the year with one offense and warning due to the amount of offenses being so high.</p>
				<h4>Section 5: Exceptions</h4>
				<p>If the officer forgets his or her body camera while on duty, the appropriate punishment must be carried out unless the officer:</p>
				<ul><li>Has a disability/injury that could possibly affect their memory</li></ul>
