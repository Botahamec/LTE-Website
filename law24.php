				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>Because of recent events involving election fraud, it seemed to be important that the candidates of an election were not involved in counting the votes. This bill aims to fix this important issue, but does offer an exception in the case that no staff member is able to fulfill the requirements given. It also prohibits the sharing of any vote by the counter of those votes, including with the person who voted this way.</p>

				<h3>Article I: Counting of Votes</h3>
				<h4>Section 1: Counter Requirements</h4>
				<p>Any candidate who is running in an election may not count the votes for that election.

The person or persons who count the votes must be a staff member of the LTE Discord Server, who is not a candidate in the election they are counting for, is not a high ranking official of a party who has a candidate in the election, and has never been in violation of Article II, Section 1 of this bill.</p>
				<h4>Section 2: Exceptions</h4>
				<p>In the case that no available staff member is able to fulfill the requirements in Article I, Section 1 of this bill, then a random available staff member, who is not a candidate in the election and has never been in violation of Article II, Section 1 of this bill, will be selected, preferably with random.org, to count the votes. In the scenario that there are still no available staff members eligible to count the votes, then a random staff member, who has never been in violation of Article II, Section 1 of this bill be be selected to count the votes. In the case that there are still no available staff members eligible to count the votes, then a random available  staff member will be selected to count the votes.</p>

				<h4>Section 1: Prohibition</h4>
				<p>The person counting the votes may not share any information about the votes to anyone in the server, except for the final result, which will not include the name, username or nickname of anyone who voted for a candidate or write-in. This includes but is not limited to: telling a person who that person voted for, telling someone who someone else voted for, giving the number of votes tallied before the election is over.</p>
				<h4>Section 2: Punishment</h4>
				<p>If the person counting the votes is found in violation of Article II, Section 1 of this bill, they will be prohibited from counting the votes in future elections, except in the case specified in Article I, Section 2 where it is allowed.</p>
