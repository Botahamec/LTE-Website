				<h3>Preamble</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Introduction</h4>
						<p>As the country becomes increasingly inundated with sick citizens taken advantage of by corporations willing to do anything for a profit, this bill shall establish the single-payer Medicare for All Program to provide all individuals residing in the United States and U.S. territories with free health care that includes all medically necessary care. This includes primary care and prevention, dietary and nutritional therapies, prescription drugs, emergency care, long-term care, mental health services, dental services, and vision care. As an act made by and for the people, patients may choose from participating physicians and institutions. Health insurers may not sell health insurance that duplicates the benefits provided under this bill. Insurers may sell benefits that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery benefits. This bill also sets forth methods to pay institutional providers and health professionals for services. Financial incentives to health organizations and physicians based on utilization are prohibited. This bill will come into effect after it has been made into law and the economic simulator is established.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: Summary</h4>
						<p>This bill establishes a unique American universal health insurance program with single-payer financing. The bill would create a publicly financed, privately delivered health care system that improves and expands the already existing Medicare program to all U.S. residents, and all residents living in U.S. territories. The goal of the legislation is to ensure that all Americans will have access, guaranteed by law, to the highest quality and most cost effective health care services regardless of their employment, income or health care status. In short, health care becomes a fundamental human right, with no financial barriers or financial harm resulting from seeking care. With 42 million uninsured Americans, and many millions more who are underinsured, the time has come to change our inefficient and costly fragmented non-system of health care. The current for-profit health care system in the U.S. is not financially sustainable over the long run, hence the need for a unique nonprofit, universal single-payer health care system.</p>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Every eligible citizen receives a “Medicare For All Card” and ID number once they enroll at the appropriate location. Social Security numbers may not be used when assigning ID cards, as they can be easily used fraudulently.</li>
							<li>This program will cover all medically necessary services, therefore services such as cosmetic surgery are not covered. Patients have their choice of physicians, providers, hospitals, clinics, and practices, and there are no co-pays or deductibles allowed.</li>
							<li>Doctors, hospitals, and clinics will continue to operate as private entities. However, they will be unable to issue stock (excluding clinics not included, such as cosmetic surgery clinics). Private health insurers shall be prohibited under this act from selling coverage that duplicates the benefits of the Improved Medicare For All program.</li>
							<li>Currently, health care costs for a typical family of four in the most common health plan offered by employers are an average of $8,584 a year ( $5,114 in premiums and another $3,470 in out-of-pocket medical services, drugs, and supplies). Employers pay an additional $12,144 towards the coverage, for a total cost per family of $20,728.  Fiscal studies by economists Dean Baker (2007) and Gerald Friedman (2013) have estimated that under the HR 676, which is closely modeled to the Universal Medicare for All Act, 95% percent of U.S. households would be paying less than they now for all health care costs.  Most businesses would pay drastically less too.</li>
						</ol>
					<h4>Section 3: Dedication</h4>
						<p>This bill is dedicated by Representative John Conyers (D-MI), as he is the inspiration and ideological foundation this bill is based on. We will fight for the bill he made for the people and by the people, despite his version being killed by Congressional Republicans.</p>
