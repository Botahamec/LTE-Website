				<h3>Preamble</h3>
				<p>Firearms have and will continue to become increasingly inundated in our lives with proper and prompt firearm reformation. This bill will accomplish three main tasks:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Once and for all close the gun show loophole that has lead to the illicit procurement of dangerous firearms. This will be accomplished by ensuring that:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Anybody who is under the age of 21 cannot operate a gun show.</li>
							<li>Anybody who has been banned from shipping/receiving firearms cannot operate a gun show.</li>
							<li>All gun show operators must be registered with the Department of Justice  (DoJ) database with photographs and fingerprints for identification.</li>
							<li>Anybody who has fabricated/concealed information in connection to gun show registration cannot operate a gun show.</li>
							<li>All gun show operators must notify the DoJ of the specific date, time and duration of any gun shows no later than 30 days prior to the show.</li>
							<li>It is unlawful to transfer the possession of a firearm at a gun show to another person not licensed unless a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer has, among other conditions, recorded the transfer with DOJ.</li>
							<li>The licensed dealer must notify the prospective transferor and transferee of the firearm that the national instant criminal background check system has provided the dealer with a unique identification number indicating that the receipt of the firearm would not violate certain federal or state firearm laws.</li>
							<li>The DOJ may enter without a warrant into any gun show, as they have reasonable cause,  since the DOJ is examining records/firearm inventory.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Expand and make background checks more efficient. This will be accomplished by:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Cleaning up the language in US Federal Code to prevent loopholes and technicalities.</li>
							<li>The creation of a DOJ and Department of Trade  interagency council, the Firearms Background Check Expansion Commission, which will create many jobs.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Prohibiting the sale, manufacture, transport, or posses a semiautomatic assault weapon (SAW) and bump stocks, barring antique guns, possession of these guns is legal for executive department officials for work purposes only, and all other exemptions listed in the bill.
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Police and DOJ enforcement.</li>
							<li>Improved serial number identification system.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>This bill will go into effect after the passing of it.</p>

				<h3>Article I: Gun Show Loophole Closure</h3>
				<h4>Section 1: Gun Show Operator Precautions</h4>
				<p>This bill makes it unlawful for any person to operate a gun show unless such person:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>has attained 21 years of age</li>
					<li>is not prohibited from transporting, shipping, or receiving firearms and has not violated any federal firearms requirements</li>
					<li>has registered with the Department of Justice (DOJ) as a gun show operator and has provided a photograph and fingerprints</li>
					<li>has not concealed material information nor made false statements in connection with a gun show operator registration</li>
					<li>notifies DOJ of the date, time, and duration of a gun show not later than 30 days before the commencement of such show and verifies the identity of each vendor at the gun show.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Section 2: Prohibition of Gun Show Firearm Sales</h4>
				<p>The bill makes it unlawful for a person not licensed under this bill to transfer possession of a firearm at a gun show to another person not licensed unless a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer has, among other conditions, recorded the transfer with DOJ.</p>
				<p>Additionally, the licensed dealer must notify the prospective transferor and transferee of the firearm that the national instant criminal background check system has provided the dealer with a unique identification number indicating that the receipt of the firearm would not violate certain federal or state firearm laws. The bill grants DOJ authority to enter, without a showing of a warrant, any place where a gun show is held or where a gun show operator is required to maintain records to examine records and inventory to determine compliance with this bill (reasonable cause).</p>

				<h3>Article II: Expansion and Optimization of the Background Check System</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Fixing Sloppy Language in Previous Bills</h4>
						<p>The following changes to 18 U.S. Code § 922:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>inserting  “or ammunition”  after “ firearm”  each place it appears except in paragraph (3);
								<p><i>Example:  [Illegal for sale of] any firearm or ammunition to any person other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector.</i></p>
							</li>
							<li>Edit paragraph 1A so that it adds:
								<p>It shall be unlawful if the firearm transfer such other person has presented to the licensee a permit that—allows such other person to possess or acquire a firearm; and was issued not more than 5 years earlier by the State in which the transfer is to take place; and the law of the State provides that such a permit is to be issued only after an authorized government official has verified that the information available to such official does not indicate that possession of a firearm by such other person would be in violation of law.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Edit paragraph 1B so that it also adds:
								<p>It shall also be unlawful in the case of an ammunition transfer such other person has presented to the licensee a permit that—allows such other person to possess or acquire a firearm; and was issued not more than 5 years earlier by the State in which the transfer is to take place; and the law of the State provides that such a permit is to be issued only after an authorized government official has verified that the information available to such official does not indicate that possession of a firearm by such other person would be in violation of law.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					<h4>Section 2: Creation of the Firearms Background Checks Commission (FBCC)</h4>
						<p>The DOJ and DOT shall work jointly in an interagency council, the FBCC, to enforce background check regulation laws and to ensure that gun dealers are fully complying with 100% of the necessary background checks. The FBCC also shall have the power to utilize rulemaking to expand upon Congressional mandates, in order to prevent the illicit procurement of firearms.</p>
						<p>The FBCC will investigate and routinely check all gun dealership records once a year to ensure that firearm dealers are fully complying with the background check laws.</p>
						<p>The FBCC may also check to see if any SAWs are sold, and if found guilty, the FBCC may fine and find violators responsible.</p>
