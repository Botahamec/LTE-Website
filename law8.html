				<h3>Preamble</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Introduction</h4>
						<p>As the country becomes increasingly inundated with a deteriorating environment with wealthy billionaire interests over the planets, this Renewable Energy and Employment Promotion Act (REEPA) aims to revitalize labor-intensive and expertise-centered jobs and green renewable energy utilization. This bill shall go into effect following the president’s signature, or passing of the bill.</p>
					<h4>Section 2: Summary</h4>
						<p>As the bill proposes so many progressive and beneficial initiatives, here is a quick summary of the major points:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The creation of the Renewable Energy Promotion Interagency Council  (REPIC) and the creation of the Renewable Energy Promotion Program (REPP) to create and sustain countless jobs in renewable energy across the country.</li>
							<li>Jobs in  energy-efficient building, construction, or retrofits industry will be support by REPP.</li>
							<li>Jobs in the renewable electric power industry, including the wind, solar, and geothermal energy industries will be supported by REPP.</li>
							<li>Jobs in the energy efficiency assessment industry that serves the residential, commercial, or industrial sectors will be supported by REPP.</li>
							<li>The Department of Labor and the Department of Energy’s REPIC will award grants to the five states with the highest alternative energy capacity every year.</li>
							<li>A minimum percentage of the electricity they sell in 2019 through 2042 from renewable resources will be added, the required annual percentage increases from 10% in 2019 to 35% for 2032 through 2042.</li>
							<li>The utilities must submit to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a quantity of federal renewable electricity credits that is equal to at least the annual percentage requirement</li>
							<li>This bill establishes requirements governing the issuance, tracking, verification, trading, banking, and retirement of federal renewable electricity credits.</li>
							<li>States may set the rates for a sale of electric energy by a facility generating electric energy from renewable energy sources pursuant to a state-approved, voluntary production incentive program.</li>
							<li>The Department of Energy must establish a program where each electric utility and natural gas utility must meet performance standards for 2019 through 2032 with respect to cumulative electricity savings and cumulative natural gas savings</li>
							<li>The performance standard increases from 1% in 2019 to 20% in 2032 for electric utilities and from 0.5% in 2019 to 13% in 2032 for natural gas utilities. In addition, the bill establishes requirements for performance standards for 2033 through 2042, and for subsequent years.</li>
							<li>DOE must review the standards at 10-year intervals and increase the standards if additional cost-effective energy efficiency potential is achievable.</li>
							<li>The bill provides for state administration of an energy efficiency program to meet the requirements of this bill.</li>
						</ul>

				<h3>Article I: The Renewable Energy Promotion Council (REPIC) and the Renewable Energy Promotion Program (REPP)</h3>
					<h4>Section 1: Grants to the Most Renewable Energy-Friendly States</h4>
						<p>The REPIC shall award grants under the pilot program to the five States with the highest installed alternative energy power capacity.</p>
						<p>A State that desires a grant under the pilot program shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such information as the Secretary may reasonably require.</p>
						<p>A grant application under the pilot program shall include the following:</p>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Evidence of the installed alternative energy power capacity for wind, solar, and geothermal facilities in that State.</li>
							<li>A description of how the funds will be used to establish and administer a program designed to provide skills training or on-the-job training for a significant number of individuals and ensure lasting and sustainable employment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.</li>
							<li>A description of the State’s option to coordinate with its State and local workforce investment boards and Energy Efficiency Industry Councils in carrying out a program funded by a grant under this Act, including through partnerships of local boards with renewable energy and energy efficiency employers and other appropriate providers of training services.</li>
							<li>A description of the skills training, on-the-job training, or both that may be offered to individuals by grant recipients, and how this training will lead to an industry-recognized certificate or similar credential.</li>
							<li>A description of how the State plans to prioritize grants among grant recipients.</li>
							<li>A description of how the grant may be used to support existing programs focused on renewable energy job creation.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The DOE shall ensure that grants are of sufficient size to enable States to carry out all required activities, however this size mustn't exceed the money appropriated to the DOE.  The DOE shall place special interest on such states that have been left stagnant following the decline of coal and other nonrenewable energy sources. While coal is unsafe, these Americans still must be employed.</p>
						<p> State receiving a grant under this section shall use the grant funds to—</p>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>reimburse a renewable energy and energy efficiency employer for the cost of providing on-the-job training;</li>
							<li>reimburse any of the following entities for the cost of providing skills training (or on-the-job training if in partnership with an energy efficient employer)—</li>
							<li>a labor organization;</li>
							<li>a postsecondary educational institution; or</li>
							<li>nonprofit organizations;</li>
						</ol>
						<p>In order to receive a grant made by a State under the REPP, a valid entity described shall:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>submit an application to the State that includes such other information and assurances as the State may require; and</li>
							<li>agree to submit to the State, for each quarter, a report containing such information as the Secretary may specify.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The DOE shall submit to Congress an annual report on the pilot program for each year of the grant period. The report on the pilot program shall include a detailed description of activities carried out under this section and an evaluation of the program, and how many participants were employed by renewable energy and energy efficiency employers within 6 months of completing the training.</p>
						<p>It is authorized to be appropriated to the DOE $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2021, for the purpose of carrying out the REPP. $5 billion shall be cut from the crop insurance program, an unneeded loophole in a law made during the Great Depression. It directly subsidizes crops, which was a very big concern in that era due to the fact that a crop failure could put the country in economic ruin. Because our nation is no longer scared of a crop failure, this program is unnecessary.</p>
