				<h3 style="color: rgb(114, 218, 137)">The Active Candidate Act</h3>
				<h6>Introduced</h6>
				<p>Recently, the LTE discord server has seen an influx in candidates that the regulars on the server do not even recognize.  This is because these candidates are not active members of the server, however they enjoy the glamour of office.  This would be ok if they were getting a few votes give or take, but these candidates are winning.  How can these candidates truly represent their region,or their party, if the members don’t even know who they are!  This bill attempts to limit the amount of inactive people who run for office.</p>

				<h3>The Congressman Inactivity Sucession Act</h3>

				<p>Inactivity is a growing crisis in our Congress. To prevent an overabundance of inactivity, I propose that the Congress can diagnose when a fellow Congressman is deemed inactive.

This fill-in must be approved by the leader of the congresspersons respective house. These Emergency Fill-Ins will go by EFI for the purposes of this bill.

				<h3>Civil Liberties Act</h3>
				<h6>Signed 07/07/18</h6>

Bush in response to the tragic terrorist attacks on 9-11 has violated the right to privacy, civil liberties, and civil rights while many sections of the bill are not effective in countering terrorism.

			<a href="law20.php"><div class="section newssection">
				<h3>Equal Treatment Act</h3>
				<h6>Signed 07/07/18</h6>
				<p>Despite significant steps forward, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) Americans lack basic legal protections in states across the country. The patchwork nature of current laws leaves millions of people subject to uncertainty and potential discrimination that impacts their safety, their families, and their day-to-day lives. Our nation’s civil rights laws protect people on the basis of race, color, national origin, and in most cases, sex, disability, and religion. But federal law does not provide consistent non-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>

			</div></a>
			<a href="law24.php"><div class="section newssection">
				<h3>Vote Counting Reform Act</h3>
				<h6>Signed 19/07/18</h6>
				<p>Because of recent events involving election fraud, it seemed to be important that the candidates of an election were not involved in counting the votes.
